# Spotify Streamer Overview

This app was written as part of the Android Nanodegree program offered by Google & Udacity. You can learn more about the program [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801). This app uses [Spotify's Web Api](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) to make search requests using artist names. The api returns the top 10 tracks for the requested artist and, when the user hits the play button, it streams a 30 second preview.
